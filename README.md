# HTML & CSS Final Project - Coding Temple

## About

Hello! This is the final project for the HTML and CSS module in coding project showcasing the skills and knowledge I have learned over the past few weeks. I learned a ton, going from never having written a single line of code to producing a nice, funcitonal and responsive webpage. Below are listed some of the things I learned about in key areas of the coding process. 

### Changes to Prompt

I changed a few of the items from the base figma design that was given to us in order to make the design more personal to me. I changed the "case studies" section to showcase my strengths as a designer as I didn't have any case studies to showcase yet.  I wanted this site to be slightly more functional currently than just entirely made up content.  I also changed the icons on the navbar to be platforms that I am currently active on, making those links fully functional. 

### Responsiveness

I learned a lot about responsiveness throughout this process. Initially, I was not thinking about responsiveness at all, and created lots of headaches for myself later down the line. I really started to learn the value of properties such as vh and vh in creating responsive designs. I initially didn't utilize those properties, and was really annoyed to be changing pixel sizes for things constantly. I was also giving width and height values to a lot of things that didn't need them, and should have relied on the margin and padding to take care of that for me. I also found use in using the zoom and scale tools when shrinking things for mobile, as they were much faster than changing every font size for every single item in a div. 

### Special Features

I learned a few extra special features throughout this process, including utilizing JavaScript for creating responsive hamburger menus and a functioning "back to top" button. I also included a smooth scrolling effect for when the links take you to sections on the page. Another fun feature I added was an ease transition to the opacity change that occurs when buttons are hovered over on the page. 


### Workflow

I am still learning so much about workflow as I learn to code, really focusing on giving things classes that make sense, and utilizing id tags only when absolutely necessary. I have only recently started to understand what working "mobile first" looks like, and am interested in focusing on that on my next project, as it seems it would make things a lot easier down the line. I also think I see the importance of coding out an entire page in the HTML before styling at all, because it would help me keep my classes consistent and make the styling process slightly easier. 

### Final Thoughts

I think this project turned out pretty well. I am happy with the final result and find it to be very functional on desktop, tablet, and phone views. I am happy with the amount of progress I have made in just a couple of weeks of learning to code and am excited about the future! On to JavaScript!
