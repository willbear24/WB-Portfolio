# Practice Developer Portfolio for Will Berendsen

## Intro

This is my first submitted project for Coding Temple! I had a lot of fun putting the HTML and CSS skill I have learned thus far in this module in building this site. 

I tried to go slightly above and beyond, adding my own design choices to the prompt. 

## Basic Code

Overall, I found this process relatively simple with the basic layout of the page in HTML. I am a visual person, so visualizing how the stacking of the divisions in the code came pretty natural to me. Where I ran into some trouble was with the CSS code, in particular, understanding the flex relationships. I was not able to get some things to do what I wanted them to do with flex, and feel like that is still an area where I would like to improve. 

## Design Choices

I tried to go with a slightly modern design, fully being aware that my skills at the moment are holding me back from really getting too fancy. I like the darker look, and think the bits of extra flair I added were pretty cool. I was able to figure out how to get the page to scroll to the section that I wanted it to when clicking the navbar links, even though only one of those sections actually exists in this example. I also had some fun with the hover effects over the projects themselves, playing with opacity and a glow effect to really help the projects stand out individually. 

## What did I learn?

I learned a lot through this process. While it took me a long time to complete it, because it was my first time, I can really see how a developer could get very fast at building pages. I also learned that there is so much flexibility one has when building pages this way. I am excited to learn more about how to put things together to be able to make more complicated pages. I also learned that I really enjoy this and it scratched a nice creative itch that I had, so that's a good sign! I also learned lots of new tricks for fun effects, some just by happy accidents where I thought "I wonder if I could change the opacity" and bam, I figured it out just like that.
